        One of my all time favouirte albums is Selfish Machines by Pierce The Veil. Released by Equal Vision Records on June 22, 2010.

        <div class="ui sixteen wide column">
        Pierce the Veil is a pop-punk, post-hardcore and experimental rock band. They are known for incorporating elements of punk, emo and even Latin influences, giving their sound a unique edge within the post-hardcore scene. Their lyrics often explore themes of heartbreak, personal struggles and resilience which resonate deeply with fans.  
             </div>
             
       <div class="ui sixteen wide column">
        Selfish Machines talks about these natural feelings to want and take the desire to be in love and the desperation for someone else to love you. This album is my favourite because of how it resonates with me.

                    This song is about a girl called Cara that vocalist Vic Fuentes used to date. Some of her possessions remained at his house after they broke up, which made Fuentes think about her when he saw them. The title is a combination of her name and the word "paraphernalia."

                    This song was inspired by a female fan telling Fuentes that her boyfriend was involved in a fatal car crash. The song was written as a gift to the fan, from the perspective of the boyfriend, telling her he is still watching over her and will love her forever.

                    This song is about admitting, "I am the selfish machine." Itâ€™s about being selfish with love and taking what you want without regret. The "selfish machine" refers to the animal inside all of us that no one ever wants to admit is there. These desires, which we often feel ashamed of, are natural aspects of being human.

                    This song revolves around the singer's parents and how they lost their house. Fuentes has said it was written as a gift to them, describing how they never let money tear them apart despite financial struggles. Like much of Fuentes' work, the song shifts between poetic imagery and stark declarations.
