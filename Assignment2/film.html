        <p><span class="ui medium red text">Fight Club</span> is an American action and thriller film made in 1999.It was directed by David Fincher. It's based on the 1996 novel of the same name by Chuck Palahniuk. It's themes are violence, consumerism, identity and pyschosis. It's my favourite movie because of the soundtrack and the characters. The soundtrack incules <i>Where is my Mind?</i> By the Pixes. My favourite character is Tyler Durden because of his rebellious spirt. I admire his confidence and how he encourages people to live authentically and break free from the mundane.</p>
