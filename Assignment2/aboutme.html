        <p>My name is Amber Mullan Williams, I'm 18 years old. I was born in Waterford, Ireland but I've lived in England for some of my life. My whole family come from the UK. I'm in my first year of Software Systems Development in SETU Waterford.I really enjoy programming and graphic design. I think it's a brilliant course for everyone, especially women as it's typically a male-dominated field.</p>
        
        <p> I like to express myself by getting piercings, tattoos and dying my hair. Right now I have dark blue hair, 15 piercings and 10 tattoos </p>
