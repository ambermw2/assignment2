    <p><b>Listening to Music-</b> My favourite thing to do is listen to music. I love a wide range of genres including indie, metal and pop. My favourite band is either Panchiko or Pierce the Veil. I listen to music all day, espiecally when I'm out on my walks.</p>
    
    <p><b>Playing Guitar-</b> Sometimes when I'm bored I pratice playing guitar. I have a Fender Jaguar squier bass at home. I can play a few songs and when ever I'm at my dad's house I pratice playing an eletric guitar. My Grandad taught me a few songs when I was younger and I've still stuck with it. </p>
    
    <p><b>Cooking</b>I love cooking meals for other people. I've done a few cooking courses and I would like to say I'm a good cook. My favourite thing to make is prawn linguine</p>
    
    <p><b>Hiking</b>I started hiking with my Dad at the age of 7 and it's still one of my favourite things to do. I've been to the comeragh's, wicklow mountains, the hill of tara and many more. Sometimes we camp out and I think its such a beautiful experience with breath-taking views.</p>
    
    <p><b>Reading</b>I love to read books, espeically horror and crime novels. I have a whole bookshelf full of books. My favourites are Misery by Stephen King and the Da Vinci Code by Dan Brown.</p>
